## Things I Did to Maximize User Interaction

### 1. Switching from Lottie to Rive
I noticed that the *Daily Friend App* uses a lot of animations to enhance interactions between users and the mascot. Since Rive supports state-based animations, I believe it's a great alternative for achieving more dynamic and interactive animations.

### 2. Adding a Scale Effect When Pressing a Button
I added a scale animation when users press voice cards or the "Next" button to provide visual feedback, making it clear that they are interacting with the UI.

### 3. Adding a Pulse Effect When Audio Is Playing
Since users cannot play multiple voices simultaneously or switch voices while one is still playing, I added a pulse animation. This helps indicate which voice is currently playing and prevents confusion.

### 4. Implementing a Toast for Error Messages
I integrated a toast notification to display errors, aligning with the functionality already implemented in the existing app.
